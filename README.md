a. What is an issue?
An issue is a feature request, bug report, or task that needs to be addressed within a repository. 

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository on GitHub. 

c. How do I open up a pull request?
Fork the repository you want to contribute to.
Create a new branch in your forked repository.
Make the desired changes to the code or documentation in your branch.
Commit the changes to your branch.
Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
Navigate to the original repository and create a pull request from your branch.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
Go to the Settings tab of your repository on GitHub.
Navigate to the Collaborators section.
Enter the GitHub username or email address of the person you want to add as a collaborator.
Click on the Add collaborator button.
The person will receive an invitation to collaborate on the repository, and once they accept, they will have access to contribute to the repository.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase locally on their machines. GitHub, on the other hand, is a platform built around Git that provides hosting for Git repositories, collaboration tools, and additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management.

f. What does git diff do?
git diff is a command used to show the differences between changes made in the working directory and the staging area or between the staging area and the repository's last commit.

g. What is the main branch?
it is the primary branch in a Git repository. It typically represents the latest stable version of the project and is where development and integration of new features occur.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No,it's not recommended to do it, especially in a collaborative environment. It's best practice to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix, make changes there, and then open a pull request to propose those changes for review and integration into the main branch. This allows for proper code review and ensures that changes are properly tested before being merged into the main branch.
